            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Quick Start</h3>
            <p>
                kataomoi is a webapp for finding people you're interested
                in who are interested in you, for any definition of
                &ldquo;interested&rdquo;. To use it, follow these steps,
                or check out the more detailed explanation below.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Choose a room name (1&ndash;32 letters, numbers,
                    periods, hyphens, and underscores, no spaces) and
                    a username (same requirements), and sign in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Invite a group of friends to sign into the same
                    room, by telling them the room name or sending
                    them the invitation link. Note that room names
                    (and usernames) are case-sensitive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look at the list of usernames, and make sure you
                    know which usernames correspond to which real
                    people.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once everyone's signed in, if you're feeling
                    security-conscious, make sure everyone has the
                    same verification phrase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check off the boxes for people you're interested
                    in, and leave the remaining boxes blank.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click &ldquo;Send Choices&rdquo; and wait for all
                    of the results to arrive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A Yes means you and another user are mutually
                    interested in each other, a No means one of you
                    isn't interested. Do what you want with this
                    information, just don't be a jerk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat with another (or the same) group of friends
                    whenever you want!
                </li>
            </ol>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Detailed Instructions</h3>
            <p>
                To get started with kataomoi, choose a room name and a
                username.  A room name and a username can each be any
                string of 1&ndash;32 letters, numbers, periods,
                hyphens, and underscores (no spaces).  Uppercase and
                lowercase letters are both allowed, and all names are
                case-sensitive.  Enter your room name and username on
                the main page, and (assuming your name isn't already
                in use in the room you want) you'll be signed into the
                room you chose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, you need to invite some friends to join you!
                Unlike <a href="https://dildo.io">dildo.io</a>, the
                MIT-only matchmaking webapp that beat us to a public
                release by several months (not that we're bitter or
                anything), kataomoi only works with groups of users
                who are all online at the same time.  Unfortunately,
                this is a fundamental limitation of the SENPAI
                cryptographic matchmaking protocol, which kataomoi is
                based on (for more details, see the <a href="about.html">About</a> section).
                So, to use kataomoi, you'll need to get together a
                group of people that includes whoever you're
                interested in; this might be your living group, a
                living group you hang out with a lot, or just some
                sort of circle of friends.  You all need to be signed
                in at the same time, but you don't necessarily all
                have to be in the same place (although, if you're
                especially security-conscious, being in the same
                physical room will be helpful; we'll explain more in a
                moment).
            </p>
            <p>
                Your friends will need to be in the same virtual
                "room" as you.  To invite them, you can tell them what
                room name you chose, or just send them the invitation
                link that appears when you sign in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you and your friends are all signed into the same
                room, you'll see a list of their usernames with
                checkboxes next to them. <b>Make absolutely sure you
                know which usernames correspond to which real people,</b> or
                you might end up confessing your undying interest in
                the wrong person entirely.  kataomoi doesn't enforce
                any constraints on usernames, except that they have to
                be 1&ndash;8 characters long.  In particular, <b>kataomoi
                usernames do not have to match users' MIT Kerberos
                usernames.</b>  We have no idea who you are or what
                your Kerberos is; we have no idea whether you're even
                an MIT student, and we really don't care either way.
                Being in the same physical place and talking to each
                other is a pretty foolproof way to figure out who's
                using what name, but if you're not all together, you
                can use some other communication channel to confirm
                names.  Be warned: if your communications aren't
                securely authenticated somehow, it's always possible
                that someone is impersonating one of your friends and
                faking messages from them.  Proceed at your own risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the bottom of the page, below the list of
                usernames, you'll also see a verification phrase.  The
                verification phrase is a 32-word nonsense phrase
                derived from the usernames in your virtual room and
                their associated cryptographic keys.  If someone
                signed into the same room as you sees a different
                verification phrase, <b>SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG AND
                YOU SHOULD PANIC</b>.  In particular, this means that
                one of the following is true:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We, the operators of kataomoi, have turned
                        evil and are trying to spy on or falsify your
                        selections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Someone has taken over our server and is
                        trying to spy on or falsify your selections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Someone is using the
                        SSL-vulnerability-of-the-month to intercept
                        and modify web traffic between your browser
                        and our server in order to spy on or falsify
                        your selections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There's a bug in our webapp.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                We hope that none of these things ever happen, and
                have taken what precautions we can to prevent them.
                If you're not concerned about any of the first three
                possibilities, then feel free to ignore the
                verification phrase.  However, if you're a
                security-conscious person like us, we recommend having
                your group take turns reading a few words of the
                phrase, and make sure you all agree (this is where
                being in the same physical place comes in handy).
                Note that the phrase will change whenever a new user
                joins the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if you can't check the verification phrase with
                everyone, checking it with as many people as you can
                is still helpful. If any subset of your group of
                people have the same verification phrase, then any
                communications among at least that subset are
                guaranteed secure (or at least, as close to guaranteed
                as anything is in this complicated and confusing world
                of buggy software and broken protocols).
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you're satisfied that everything's secure, time
                to select who you're interested in!  Go through the
                list of usernames, and if you're interested in
                someone, check off the box in the &ldquo;DTF?&rdquo;
                column; otherwise, leave it blank.  (Note:
                &ldquo;DTF&rdquo; means nothing. &ldquo;DTF&rdquo;
                means everything. &ldquo;DTF&rdquo; means whatever you
                want it to mean.  kataomoi is not exclusively, or even
                primarily, designed for finding sexual partners; our
                only reason for using &ldquo;DTF&rdquo; is to comply
                with tradition.)
            </p>
            <p>
                When you're done selecting people, click the
                &ldquo;Send Choices&rdquo; button; the code running in
                your browser will perform cryptographic exchanges with
                the code running in everyone else's browsers, and
                eventually give you a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or
                &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer for each user in the list. A
                Yes answer indicates mutual interest; a No answer
                indicates that at least one of you isn't interested in
                the other one.  Therefore, if you leave someone's
                checkbox blank, you're guaranteed to see a No answer
                for that person.  If you check someone's checkbox,
                then the answer you see indicates whether they checked
                your box or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've found out everyone's answers, what you do
                next is all up to you.  If you found a match, we
                recommend going and talking to them, either
                immediately or shortly afterward, and figuring out
                what kind of things you'd like to do together.
                &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; you might say, &ldquo;So, um, it
                looks like we matched on kataomoi?  Want to go grab
                dinner at Veggie Galaxy sometime and talk about
                things?&rdquo; Other appropriate responses include
                (with proper consent) making out on the spot, falling
                into a sweet embrace filled with burning passion, or
                grabbing a duffel bag full of clothes and a box of
                matches and riding off into the night together on a
                stolen motorcycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                And, if you find out that someone you're interested in
                isn't interested in you: feel free to deal with that
                in whatever way is healthiest for you, but just
                please, don't be a jerk.  People feel the way they
                feel, and there isn't anything you can do about it,
                and sometimes it's terrible and sucky, but that's just
                the way it goes.  You are a beautiful amazing person,
                and we believe in you, and we know that someday you'll
                find whatever it is you're looking for.  You got this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, you can always use kataomoi again later
                with another (or the same) group of people.  Your
                username and room name aren't permanent; your browser
                forgets all of it once you close the tab, and once
                everyone's gone, the room disappears.
            </p>
