            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                You never believed in love at first sight before, but
                here, standing right in front of you, is the person of
                your dreams.  They're beautiful, clever, funny; every
                word they say holds you spellbound.  You'd like to
                tell them how you feel, but you're too scared &mdash;
                what if they don't like you that way, and you end up
                making things awkward?  Your friend Max runs a
                matchmaking webapp called
                <a href="https://dildo.io">dildo.io</a>;
                you could use that, but&hellip;
            </p>
            <p>
                There's something about this person; maybe it's the
                slogans on the buttons pinned to their bag, or the
                cold flame of justice that burns deep within their
                eyes, or the edge that creeps into their voice when
                they talk about politics&hellip; Whatever it is, you
                have a feeling in your gut that sometime soon, the
                government will have a lot of very interesting
                questions for anyone who's gotten too close to this
                person.  You trust Max not to hand over the dildo.io
                database willingly, but there's no telling how long
                he'll last once they start waterboarding him.  You
                can't use dildo.io; it's just too much of a risk.  But
                then how can you find out how the love of your life
                feels about you?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Concept and History</h3>
            <p>
                kataomoi is a webapp for finding people you're
                interested in who are interested in you, for any
                definition of &ldquo;interest&rdquo;.  If you've used
                or heard of <a href="https://dildo.io">dildo.io</a>,
                this works on similar principles: You select people
                who you're interested in, other people select who
                they're interested in, and if you're interested in
                someone who's interested in you, we tell both of you.
                What you do with that information afterwards is up to
                you.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site and dildo.io have some important
                differences, though.  These differences all stem from
                our key guiding principle:
                cryptographically-guaranteed privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you select people on dildo.io, that information
                goes into a database on the server.  The webapp checks
                the database to find mutually-interested pairs, and
                then notifies both parties.  This means that in
                theory, a malicious server operator could also look
                through the database and see who's interested in who,
                mutually or otherwise.  Although we know and trust the
                operators of dildo.io, this setup still feels
                suboptimal, and as the paranoid crypto-anarchists we
                are, we'd like to try and do better.
            </p>
            <p>
                In late 2015, we started a months-long cryptography
                research program with the goal of developing a
                maximally secure, easily implementable cryptographic
                protocol for identifying mutual interest.  Building on
                work by
                <a href="http://scottaaronson.com/">Scott Aaronson</a>,
                we developed the SENPAI protocol, which allows two
                people to learn whether they're mutually interested in
                each other, without leaking any other information to
                either person or to any eavesdropper or mediator.
                Assuming the security of the RSA cryptosystem, the
                SENPAI protocol is secure against any adversary except
                for a partner who is willing to get caught in an
                outright lie.  (No matchmaking protocol can protect
                against someone who claims to be interested and then
                changes their mind; jerks will be jerks, with or
                without technology.)
            </p>

                Our <a href="http://duxovni.org/projects/kataomoi/senpai.pdf">research paper</a>
                and <a href="http://duxovni.org/projects/kataomoi/senpai.odp">presentation</a> on
                the SENPAI protocol were well-received at the
                prestigious <a href="http://sigtbd.csail.mit.edu/">SIGTBD</a> research
                conference.  Buoyed by this success, we continued
                working toward a practical implementation. Many long
                months of slacking-off later, the result now stands
                before you: kataomoi, the cryptographic matchmaking
                webapp that you don't need to trust with your secrets.

            <h3>Differences from dildo.io</h3>
            <p>
                The cryptographic security of kataomoi comes along
                with some practical design consequences, and it isn't
                quite a drop-in replacement for dildo.io.  kataomoi
                and dildo.io differ in the following ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        While dildo.io lets you select users by MIT
                        kerberos usernames, as verified by MIT client
                        certificates, kataomoi allows users to choose
                        whatever usernames they want.  This could
                        possibly be changed in a future release, but
                        we had enough weird crypto stuff to implement
                        already and didn't want to deal with
                        authenticating users' names.  We also don't
                        want this webapp to be restricted to the MIT
                        community. There's too much of a tendency
                        around here to think of problems and solutions
                        in terms of just this campus rather than the
                        larger world; we'd like to be more inclusive
                        and egalitarian in our work.  dildo.io has
                        good technical reasons for restricting its
                        userbase to MIT; it makes authentication of
                        real identities a lot easier, which is
                        something kataomoi still struggles with at the
                        moment.  But we believe that we can solve this
                        problem while still being open for everyone,
                        everywhere to use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        dildo.io allows you to see how many other
                        users were selected by people you matched
                        with, and prevent matches with people who
                        selected too many users.  There are legitimate
                        reasons to want this feature, but it's
                        fundamentally impossible with our privacy
                        constraints, since nobody except you knows
                        anything about who you selected (except for
                        people who select you, and learn only whether
                        you selected them).  If some jerk decides to
                        select everyone's usernames to find out who's
                        interested in them, then they'll get outed as
                        a jerk and hopefully dealt with appropriately;
                        we don't have any better answer here.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While dildo.io lets you select people from the
                        set of all current MIT students whenever you
                        want, kataomoi only works with groups of users
                        who are all online at the same time and signed
                        into the same virtual room.  The requirement
                        that users are online at the same time is a
                        fundamental consequence of having a protocol
                        where the server doesn't learn users' choices:
                        since the server doesn't get any information,
                        the users need to give each other information
                        while exchanging messages, and so one of them
                        must be the first to learn whether there's
                        mutual interest.  That user then needs to share
                        this result with the other user immediately;
                        otherwise, they could just pretend to always
                        be offline and never reveal the result to
                        their communication partner.  Thus, the SENPAI
                        protocol can only be conducted while both
                        participants are online.
                        <i>(Exercise for the reader: construct a
                        protocol where, over many rounds of messages,
                        users gain increasingly high probabilistic
                        confidence in the result of the protocol, such
                        that neither user has substantially more
                        information than their partner at any given
                        point in the exchange.  This would allow the
                        real-time requirement to be relaxed, but it'd
                        require a much longer exchange of messages, so
                        it would take ages for the exchange to finish
                        unless both users came online at some point.
                        Seriously, though, it'd be awesome if someone
                        designed this!)</i>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                However, in exchange for these arguable disadvantages
                over dildo.io, kataomoi provides much stronger
                privacy guarantees. Here is the complete list of
                things that we learn about you when you use kataomoi:
                <ul>
                    <li>Your IP address (unless you're using the Tor
                    Browser; we've tested it on this site, it should
                    work fine)</li>
                    <li>Your browser version</li>
                    <li>What time you connect, sign in, and disconnect</li>
                    <li>The room name and username you choose</li>
                    <li>All of the same identifying information for
                    everyone who signs into the same room as you</li>
                </ul>
                As long as the static web pages your browser downloads
                from this server are correct, your browser shouldn't
                be revealing any other information to the server.
                (It's also possible for an evil server, or an
                eavesdropper who can circumvent the protections of
                HTTPS, to set and read cookies from your browser
                without modifying the page content.)  If you're
                worried about us turning evil or getting hacked, you
                can clone our <a href="https://github.com/ichung/kataomoi">Github repository</a> and
                open your local copy of the <code>client/index.html</code>
                file in your web browser after verifying the contents;
                this should work just as well as visiting the webpage
                hosted here, except that it won't show you a link to
                invite friends.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Conclusion/Manifesto</h3>
            <p>
                Our concerns about perfect cryptographic security and
                malicious server operators may seem silly and
                paranoid.  However, in today's world, too many people
                (and especially too many programmers) don't take these
                issues seriously enough.  We live in an age of mass
                surveillance, perpetrated by both governments and
                advertising companies, and facilitated by software
                companies that are too careless or too greedy to fight
                back.  We present kataomoi to the world as a practical
                lesson in how little data you actually need in order
                to solve interesting problems, and hope that it will
                encourage others to think carefully about how the
                systems they build affect flows of power and
                information.
